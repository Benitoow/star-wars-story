# Changelog

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-17

### Bugfixes & cleanup (SvelteKit app)

- **Added `showToast` helper** to `ui.ts` — was used in every route but never exported, breaking all notifications.
- **Fixed editor store usage** — `currentSetup` was mutated directly (invalid on a derived store); replaced with `updateSetupField()`. `story.update()` on a derived store replaced with `updateContent()`. Textarea `bind:value` on a read-only store replaced with controlled `value` + `on:input`.
- **Fixed trash page** — `loadTrash()` returned all stories (deleted and active); now filters to `isDeleted === true` only.
- **Removed duplicate `<Sidebar>` and `<Header>`** from settings, editor, and trash pages — the layout already renders them, causing double sidebars and headers.
- **Created `PageHeader.svelte`** component — per-page title bar with back button and actions slot, used by settings, editor, and trash.
- **Removed phantom Image Generation settings** — DALL-E / Stable Diffusion / Midjourney UI options had no implementation behind them.
- **Wired keyboard shortcuts** in layout — `Ctrl+N` (new story), `Ctrl+F` (search), `Ctrl+B` (sidebar), `Ctrl+,` (settings) now actually work.
- **Added Dexie v3 index** for `setup.era` and `setup.faction` — dashboard filters previously triggered full table scans.
- **Fixed `index.html`** — replaced invalid double-`<html>` document (legacy app stub prepended to full HTML) with a clean dev instructions page.
- **Cleaned up `sw.js`** — removed dead background sync stub (`syncStories`) that only logged to console.
- **Added build config** — `package.json`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json` were missing from the repository, making the project impossible to install or build.
